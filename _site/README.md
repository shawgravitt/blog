# My blog and portfolio 

Design is based on Strata Reloaded(https://github.com/old-jekyll-templates/Strata-Jekyll-Theme) with my own edits and updates.

## Develop

Install the dependencies with [Bundler](http://bundler.io/):

~~~bash
$ bundle install
~~~

Run `jekyll` commands through Bundler to ensure you're using the right versions:

~~~bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
~~~
